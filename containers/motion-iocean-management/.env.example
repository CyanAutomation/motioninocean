# Motion In Ocean - Management Mode Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and adjust as needed for your deployment

# Docker Image Tag (version to run)
# Default: latest
MOTION_IN_OCEAN_IMAGE_TAG=latest

# Web Server Port
# Default: 8001 (to avoid conflict with webcam mode on 8000)
MOTION_IN_OCEAN_PORT=8001

# Bind Host (address to listen on)
# Default: 127.0.0.1 (localhost only)
# Set to 0.0.0.0 to listen on all interfaces (required for remote node discovery)
MOTION_IN_OCEAN_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0

# Timezone
# Default: Europe/London
TZ=Europe/London

# Mock Camera Mode (for testing)
# Set to 'true' to use synthetic camera
# Default: false
MOCK_CAMERA=false

# Optional: Bearer token for authentication
# Leave empty to disable authentication (default, suitable for localhost)
# Set to any string to require bearer token auth on protected endpoints
MANAGEMENT_AUTH_TOKEN=

# Node Discovery Shared Secret
# Required for webcam nodes that self-register via /api/discovery/announce.
# Must match DISCOVERY_TOKEN on webcam nodes.
# Leave empty to disable discovery announcements.
NODE_DISCOVERY_SHARED_SECRET=

# SSRF Protection: Allow Private IPs
# SECURITY WARNING: Only enable for internal networks you trust!
# When disabled (default), blocks connections to private IP ranges (10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, 172.16.x.x)
# to prevent server-side request forgery attacks.
# Discovery announcements using private/LAN IPs are blocked unless this is true.
# Enable only if:
#  1. Your management node can only reach internal/trusted networks
#  2. You need to connect to webcam nodes using private IPs directly
#  3. You understand the security implications
# Recommended: Always use docker network hostnames instead (e.g., 'webcam-container:8000')
# See: Node Connectivity Troubleshooting in README
# Default: false
MOTION_IN_OCEAN_ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS=false

# Docker Socket Proxy Configuration (for docker transport)
# Only needed if using 'docker' transport for remote node connections
# Default proxy port if using docker-socket-proxy service

# Motion In Ocean - Mock Camera Overlay
# Remove device dependencies for testing without hardware
#
# Usage (standard mock - black frames):
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mock.yml up -d
#
# Usage (with cat GIFs - recommended for fun!):
#   MOCK_CAMERA=true CAT_GIF=true docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mock.yml up -d
#
# This is useful for testing on non-Pi environments or when hardware is not available
#
# Note: You can also use .env file with:
#   MOCK_CAMERA=true
#   CAT_GIF=true

# Motion In Ocean image tag - can be pinned to specific version
MOTION_IN_OCEAN_IMAGE_TAG=latest

# Motion In Ocean web interface port
# Valid range: 1024-65535 (use unprivileged ports 1024+ for security)
MOTION_IN_OCEAN_PORT=8000

# Camera Resolution (WIDTHxHEIGHT)
# Detected camera: IMX219 (3280x2464 max)
# Hardware-specific recommendations for balanced performance:
#   Pi 3: 1280x720 or 1640x1232 (limited CPU, prioritize lower resolutions)
#   Pi 4: 1920x1080 (good balance of quality and performance)
#   Pi 5: 1920x1080 or 2592x1944 (can handle higher resolutions smoothly)
# Note: Higher resolutions increase CPU usage, memory, and network bandwidth
MOTION_IN_OCEAN_RESOLUTION=1640x1232

# Frame Rate (FPS) - 0 uses camera default
# Hardware-specific recommendations:
#   Pi 3: 30fps @ 1640x1232, 25fps @ 1920x1080 (CPU-limited, lower FPS for higher resolutions)
#   Pi 4: 30fps @ 1920x1080, up to 60fps @ 1280x720 (better performance, more headroom)
#   Pi 5: 60fps @ 1920x1080, up to 120fps @ 1280x720 (best performance, handles high FPS well)
# Note: Higher FPS increases CPU usage and network bandwidth. Monitor system load.
MOTION_IN_OCEAN_FPS=25

# JPEG Quality (1-100)
# Higher values = better quality but larger file sizes
MOTION_IN_OCEAN_JPEG_QUALITY=90

# Edge Detection - set to 'true' to enable
MOTION_IN_OCEAN_EDGE_DETECTION=false

# CORS Origins - comma-separated list of allowed origins (* for all)
# ⚠️  For production, replace * with specific origins (e.g., http://homeassistant.local:8123)
# Using * allows any website to access your camera stream

# Mock Camera - set to 'true' for testing without real hardware
MOCK_CAMERA=false

# Healthcheck Ready - set to 'true' when ready for health checks
# Set to 'true' once initial testing is complete and container should report health status.
# When 'false', health checks run but don't affect container state (useful during setup/debugging).
# Enable this for production deployments with orchestrators (Docker Swarm, Kubernetes) that
# rely on health status for automated restarts and traffic routing.

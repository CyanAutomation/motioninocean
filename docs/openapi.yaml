  title: Motion In Ocean Management API
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: |
    REST API for the Motion In Ocean management hub.

    Provides node registry management, discovery, status aggregation, and settings
    for distributed Raspberry Pi camera deployments.

    **Authentication**

    Most endpoints require a bearer token supplied via the `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
    header.  The token is configured on the server with the `MIO_MANAGEMENT_AUTH_TOKEN`
    environment variable.  If no token is configured, authentication is disabled.

    The discovery announcement endpoint (`POST /api/v1/discovery/announce`) uses a
    separate token configured with `MIO_NODE_DISCOVERY_SHARED_SECRET`.

    **Versioning**

    All stable routes are served under `/api/v1/`.  The unversioned `/api/` paths (e.g.
    `/api/webcams`) are deprecated aliases that return HTTP 308 Permanent Redirect to the
    versioned equivalents.

    **Swift client generation**

    This spec is compatible with `swift-openapi-generator`.  Fetch it from
    `GET /openapi.json` (no authentication required) and generate a typed URLSession
    client with:

    ```
    swift package plugin generate-code-from-openapi --target MotionInOceanClient
    ```

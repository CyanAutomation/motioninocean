# Copy this file to .env and customize as needed

# Docker Image Tag
MOTION_IN_OCEAN_IMAGE_TAG=latest

# Port to expose the web interface on
MOTION_IN_OCEAN_PORT=8000

# Camera Resolution (WIDTHxHEIGHT)
# Common values: 640x480, 1280x720, 1920x1080
# Maximum: 4096x4096 (hardware dependent)
MOTION_IN_OCEAN_RESOLUTION=640x480

# Frame Rate (FPS)
# 0 = use camera default
# Maximum recommended: 120 FPS
MOTION_IN_OCEAN_FPS=0

# JPEG Quality (1-100)
# Lower values reduce bandwidth but decrease image quality
# 100 is maximum quality (default)
# Set to 80 for a good balance between quality and bandwidth
# Set to 60-70 for bandwidth-constrained networks
MOTION_IN_OCEAN_JPEG_QUALITY=100

# Edge Detection
# Set to 'true' to enable Canny edge detection on the video stream
# This adds CPU overhead but can be useful for motion detection pipelines
MOTION_IN_OCEAN_EDGE_DETECTION=false

# Mock Camera Mode (for testing without hardware)
# Set to 'true' to use synthetic test patterns instead of real camera
MOCK_CAMERA=false

# Timezone (for logging timestamps)
# Format: Region/City (e.g., America/New_York, Europe/London, Asia/Tokyo)

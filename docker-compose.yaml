services:
  # Single unified Motion In Ocean service
  # Controlled by MOTION_IN_OCEAN_MODE environment variable (webcam or management)
  # APP_MODE determines which endpoints and functionality are available at runtime:
  #   - webcam: Camera streaming endpoints (/stream.mjpg, /snapshot.jpg), readiness probe waits for stream
  #   - management: Node registry management API endpoints (/api/nodes/*), immediate readiness
  # All device mappings and volumes are included; management mode safely ignores unused camera devices.
